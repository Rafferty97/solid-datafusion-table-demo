Plan:

- Flesh out `engine` into a reusable datafusion wrapper
  - Fluent JS API for constructing logical plans
  - Expression parser
  - Excellent error reporting
  - `RecordSet` which internally uses `apache-arrow` JS crate
  - Read data files from JS land
  - Byte transforms (encoding, newlines, etc.)
- Will probably need to wrap the Rust-generated JS code in another typscript package
- First step is probably to settle on final typescript API

Bugs/fixes:

- duplicate column names in CSV
